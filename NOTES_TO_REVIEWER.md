# Notes to Reviewer

LaserSell is a read-only telemetry dashboard that displays trading performance and session data in a side panel.

How to test:
1. Install the extension.
2. Click the toolbar icon to open the popup.
3. Enter pairing code: <DEMO_PAIRING_CODE>
4. Click Connect.
5. Click Open Side Panel (or click the extension icon) to view the dashboard.

Demo data is synthetic. The extension does not collect or store wallet keys.
